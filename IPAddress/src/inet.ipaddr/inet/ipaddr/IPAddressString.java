/**
 * Parses the string representation of an IP address.  Such a string can represent just a single address like 1.2.3.4 or 1:2:3:4:6:7:8, or a subnet like 1.2.0.0/16 or 1.*.1-3.1-4 or 1111:222::/64.
 * <p>
 * This supports a much wider range of address string formats than InetAddress.getByName.  It supports subnet formats, provides specific error messages, and allows more specific configuration.
 * <p>
 * You can control all of the supported formats using {@link IPAddressStringParameters.Builder} to build a parameters instance of {@link IPAddressStringParameters}.
 * When not using the constructor that takes a {@link IPAddressStringParameters}, a default instance of {@link IPAddressStringParameters} is used that is generally permissive.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Supported formats</h2>
 * Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.
 * <p>
 * Subnets are supported:
 * <ul>
 * <li>wildcards '*' and ranges '-' (for example 1.*.2-3.4), useful for working with subnets</li>
 * <li>the wildcard '*' can span multiple segments, so you can represent all addresses with '*', all IPv4 with '*.*', or all IPv6 with '*:*'</li>
 * <li>SQL wildcards '%' and '_', although '%' is considered an SQL wildcard only when it is not considered an IPv6 zone indicator</li>
 * <li>CIDR network prefix length addresses, like 1.2.0.0/16, which is equivalent to 1.2.*.* (all-zero hosts are the full subnet, non-zero hosts are single addresses)</li>
 * <li>address/mask pairs, in which the mask is applied to the address, like 1.2.3.4/255.255.0.0, which is also equivalent to 1.2.*.*</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * You can combine these variations, such as 1.*.2-3.4/255.255.255.0
 * <p>
 * IPv6 is fully supported:
 * <ul>
 * <li>IPv6 addresses like ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff</li>
 * <li>IPv6 zones or scope identifiers, like ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff%zone</li>
 * <li>IPv6 mixed addresses are supported, which are addresses for which the last two IPv6 segments are represented as IPv4, like ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:255.255.255.255</li>
 * <li>IPv6 compressed addresses like ::1</li>
 * <li>A single value of 32 hex digits like 00aa00bb00cc00dd00ee00ff00aa00bb with or without a preceding hex delimiter 0x</li>
 * <li>A base 85 address comprising 20 base 85 digits like 4)+k&amp;C#VzJ4br&gt;0wv%Yp as in rfc 1924 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1924</li>
 * <li>Binary, preceded by 0b, either with binary segments that comprise all 16 bits like ::0b0000111100001111 or a single segment address of 0b followed by 128 binary bits.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All of the above subnet variations work for IPv6, whether network prefix lengths, masks, ranges or wildcards.
 * Similarly, all the above subnet variations work for any supported IPv4 format, such as the standard dotted-decimal IPv4 format as well as the inet_aton formats listed below.
 * <p>
 * This class support all address formats of the C routine inet_pton and the Java method java.net.InetAddress.getByName.
 * This class supports all IPv4 address formats of the C routine inet_aton as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>IPv4 hex: 0x1.0x2.0x3.0x4 (0x prefix)</li>
 * <li>IPv4 octal: 01.02.03.0234.  Note this clashes with the same address interpreted as dotted decimal</li>
 * <li>3-part IPv4: 1.2.3 (which is interpreted as 1.2.0.3 (ie the third part covers the last two)</li>
 * <li>2-part IPv4: 1.2 (which is interpreted as 1.0.0.2 (ie the 2nd part covers the last 3)</li>
 * <li>1-part IPv4: 1 (which is interpreted as 0.0.0.1 (ie the number represents all 4 segments, and can be any number of digits less than the 32 digits which would be interpreted as IPv6)</li>
 * <li>hex or octal variants of 1, 2, and 3 part, such as 0xffffffff (which is interpreted as 255.255.255.255)</li>
 * </ul>
 * Also supported are binary segments of a 0b followed by binary digits like 0b1.0b1010.2.3, or a single segment address of 0b followed by all 32 bits.
 * <br>
 * inet_aton (and this class) allows mixing octal, hex and decimal (e.g. 0xa.11.013.11 which is equivalent to 11.11.11.11).  
 * String variations using prefixes, masks, ranges, and wildcards also work for inet_aton style.
 * The same can be said of binary segments, they can be mixed with all other formats.
 * <p>
 * Note that there is ambiguity when supporting both inet_aton octal and dotted-decimal leading zeros, like 010.010.010.010 which can 
 * be interpreted as octal or decimal, thus it can be either 8.8.8.8 or 10.10.10.10, with the default behaviour using the former interpretation<p>
 * This behaviour can be controlled by {@link IPAddressStringParameters.Builder#getIPv4AddressParametersBuilder()} and 
 * {@link inet.ipaddr.ipv4.IPv4AddressStringParameters.Builder#allowLeadingZeros(boolean)} 
 * <p>
 * Some additional formats:
 * <ul>
 * <li>null or empty strings are interpreted as the loopback, in the same way as InetAddress.getByName interprets null or empty strings</li>
 * <li>as noted previously, the single wildcard address "*" represents all addresses both ipv4 and ipv6, 
 * although you need to give it some help when converting to IPAddress by specifying the IP version in {@link #getAddress(IPVersion)} or {@link #toAddress(IPVersion)}</li>
 * <li>specifying CIDR prefix lengths with no corresponding addresses are interpreted as the corresponding network mask.  For instance,
 *  /64 is interpreted as the 64 bit network mask (ie 64 ones followed by 64 zeros)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If you have an address in which segments have been delimited with commas, such as "1,2.3.4,5.6", you can parse this with {@link #parseDelimitedSegments(String)}
 * which gives an iterator of strings.  For "1,2.3.4,5.6" you will iterate through "1.3.4.6", "1.3.5.6", "2.3.4.6" and "2.3.5.6".
 * You can count the number of elements in such an iterator with {@link #countDelimitedAddresses(String)}.  
 * Each string can then be used to construct an IPAddressString.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * Once you have constructed an IPAddressString object, you can convert it to an IPAddress object with various methods.  
 * It is as simple as:<br>
 * <pre><code>
 * {@link IPAddress} address = new {@link IPAddressString}("1.2.3.4").{@link #getAddress()};
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * If your application takes user input IP addresses, you can validate with:
 * <pre><code>
 * try {
 *  {@link IPAddress} address = new IPAddressString("1.2.3.4").{@link #toAddress()};
 * } catch({@link AddressStringException} e) {
 *	//e.getMessage() provides description of validation failure
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * Most address strings can be converted to an IPAddress object using {@link #getAddress()} or {@link #toAddress()}.  In most cases the IP version is determined by the string itself.
 * <p>
 * There are a few exceptions, cases in which the version is unknown or ambiguous, for which {@link #getAddress()} returns null:
 * <ul>
 * <li>strings which do not represent valid addresses (eg "bla")</li>
 * <li>ambiguous address strings (eg "/32" is a prefix that could be IPv4 or IPv6).  For such strings you can provide the IPv4/IPv6 version to {@link #getAddress(IPVersion)} to get an address.</li>
 * <li>the "all" address "*" which represents all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  For this string you can provide the IPv4/IPv6 version to {@link #getAddress(IPVersion)} to get an address representing either all IPv4 or all IPv6 addresses.</li>
 * <li>empty string "" is interpreted as the default loopback address.  You can provide the ipv4/ipv6 version to{@link #getAddress(IPVersion)}to get the loopback version of your choice.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The other exception is a subnet in which the range of values in a segment of the subnet are not sequential, for which {@link #getAddress()} throws {@link IncompatibleAddressException} because there is no single IPAddress value, there would be many.
 * An IPAddress instance requires that all segments can be represented as a range of values.
 * There are only two unusual circumstances when this can occur:
 * <ul>
 * <li>using masks on subnets specified with wildcard or range characters causing non-sequential segments such as the final IPv4 segment of 0.0.0.* with mask 0.0.0.128, 
 * this example translating to the two addresses 0.0.0.0 and 0.0.0.128, so the last IPv4 segment cannot be represented as a sequential range of values.</li>
 * <li>using wildcards or range characters in the IPv4 section of an IPv6 mixed address causing non-sequential segments such as the last IPv6 segment of ::ffff:0.0.*.0, 
 * this example translating to the addresses ::ffff:0:100, ::ffff:0:200, , ::ffff:0:300, ..., so the last IPv6 segment cannot be represented as a sequential range of values.</li>
 * </ul>
 * These exceptions do not occur with non-subnets (ie individual addresses), nor can they occur with standard CIDR prefix-based subnets.
 * <p>
 * This class is thread-safe.  In fact, IPAddressString objects are immutable.  
 * An IPAddressString object represents a single IP address representation that cannot be changed after construction.
 * Some of the derived state is created upon demand and cached, such as the derived IPAddress instances.
 * <p>
 * This class has a few methods with analogs in IPAddress, such as {@link #contains(IPAddressString)}, {@link #getSequentialRange()},
 * {@link #prefixEquals(IPAddressString)}, {@link #isIPv4()}, and {@link #isIPv6()}.
 * Such methods are provided to make creating the IPAddress instance unnecessary when no such IPAddress instance is needed for other reasons.  
 * <p>
 * For some methods, like {@link #getSequentialRange()} and {@link #getDivisionGrouping()},
 * there might not even be an associated IPAddress due to IncompatibleAddressException.  
 * However, this is generally only the case with subnets that have non-standard and unusual formats or masks.
