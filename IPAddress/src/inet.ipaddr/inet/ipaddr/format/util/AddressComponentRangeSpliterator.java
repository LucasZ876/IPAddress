/**
 * AddressComponentSpliterator is a {@link java.util.Spliterator} for address items.
 * <p>
 * The implementation of estimateSize() and getExactSizeIfKnown() provide exact sizes if the size is no larger than Long.MAX_VALUE.
 * It also provides a getSize() method returning BigInteger providing the exact size at all times.
 * <p>
 * An AddressComponentSpliterator instance has the spliterator characteristics of being concurrent, non-null, sorted, ordered, and distinct. 
 * When the size is no larger than Long.MAX_VALUE, it is also sized and sub-sized, 
 * but practically speaking it is actually always sized and sub-sized since the exact size as a BigInteger is always available from getSize(),
 * which is not a part of the {@link java.util.Spliterator} interface.
 * <p>
 * Unlike the default spliterator that you get with any iterator, which has linear-time splitting, all instances of AddressItemRangeSpliterator split in constant-time,
 * therefore allowing for instant parallel iteration over subnets or subnet components.
 * <p>
 * Splitting can be attempted at any time, including after iteration has started.  All spliterators will split the address component range roughly in half.
 * Segment spliterators will split the remaining range exactly in half.  Other spliterators will split the original range roughly in half.
 * <p>
 * An instance of AddressItemRangeSpliterator is not thread-safe.  
 * Parallel iteration derives from handing each additional AddressItemRangeSpliterator returned from trySplit() to other threads.
