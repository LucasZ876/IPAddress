# IPAddress-go

The [**Go**](https://golang.org/) implementation of IPAddress

go get github.com/seancfoley/ipaddress/ipaddress-go/ipaddr

The API is similar to other implementations, the differences consisting primarily being those nuances of the go language, such as the lack of inheritance, differences with the permission modifiers (capitalization vs public/protected/private), more specific primitive types (eg uint64) and others.
