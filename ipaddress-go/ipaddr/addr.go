// EARLIER THOUGHTS, JUST KEEPING THEM AROUND IN CASE I FORGET THE REASONING,
// but now we decided to use pointers to IPAddress and not zero values with no pointers, pretty well everywhere
// One breakthrugh was realizing you could scale up and down using unsafe.Pointer, avoiding copying
// But we also decided we would make copying possible without losing cache values, by assigning a cache object on creation and pointing to it
// The rest would be immutable stuff

//xxx do we want to be like string, where the nil is an actual string? xxxx
//xxx a nil address? xxx
//xxx or like slice, which has a nil xxx
//xxxx I have already decided with the ToXXX() I would default to zero values xxxx
//xxxx maybe we do that everywhere?  Here too?
//xxxx toughie question
//xxxx time to answer it
//xxxx Well, even slice does not resort to pointers
//xxxx And I am not doing that in my address methods, am I?
//xxxx As a test, I should what happens with this:

//xxx OK, so that means, if you have a pointer receiver, there is no way to upscale and end up with the same pointer
//xxx So let us stick to avoiding pointers
//xxx Now, back to here
//xxx Does it make sense to use a pointer as a stand-in to mean "no address"
//xxx or should we use zero values?
//xxx I am starting to think perhaps a nil value would do here on these three
//xxx and then, what about the mask?  Pointer?
//Actually, maybe pointer, because in many ways it makes little sense that a parsing results in a zero value
//Or does it?
//OK, I think I like the way mask is done, it is like PrefixLen
//And I think maybe these should remain as is
//
// OK no, I think zero value should not be used in random situations
// And in fact why did we use it?  TO avoid an error.
// We do not have that here.
// SO just use a pointer.
